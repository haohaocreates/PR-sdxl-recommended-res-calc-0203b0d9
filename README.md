Here's a simple script to calculate the recommended initial latent size for SDXL image generation and its Upscale Factor based on the desired Final Resolution output.

According to many references, it's advised to avoid arbitrary resolutions and stick to this initial resolution, as SDXL was trained using this specific resolution.

Windows:
1. Download / zip download this repo, make sure .Py and .Bat file on same folder.
2. Double click .Bat file!
3. Input your desired Final Resolution
4. You'll get recommended SDXL Initial Image Size, and its upscale factor to reach the Final Resolution.

If you are on Linux, use .Sh file instead, and before running it make sure to chmod+x it first.
